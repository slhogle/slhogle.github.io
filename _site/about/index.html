I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the <a href="https://chisholmlab.mit.edu/">Chisholm Laboratory</a> at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>. I recieved my Ph.D from the <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> at <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>, and I took my undergraduate degree in Chemistry at <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/">Earlham College</a>.</p> <!-- Below is a non-technical(ish) description of my research and why it is important. If you are interested read on! ___ ___ Bacteria are everywhere. Certain ones can make you sick, while an entire ecosystem of others living in your gut can make you well. Some bacteria have to eat carbon to grow (just like you and me) while others can perform photosynthesis to get their carbon for growth. And just like you and me, bacteria that eat carbon compounds "breath" oxygen and "exhale" carbon dioxide. Even though bacteria are physically very small, there are __SO MANY__ living on the planet that their net effect of eating, growing, breathing, exhaling, and moving around is enormous. As a scientist, I'm interested in bacteria that live in the ocean and eat the carbon compounds produced by marine photosynthesizers. Half of all the biomass generated from photosynthesis on our planet exists in our oceans. Over time some of that biomass sinks all the way to the bottom of the ocean and is "trapped" for millions of years. The net effect is a __removal of carbon dioxide from the planetary system__. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and our planet's climate is very sensitive to the amount in the atmosphere. As humans have burned more fossil fuels and released more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the planet has warmed. _RIGHT NOW_ this warming is altering weather patterns, sea level, glacial cover, and many other things. A very important part of understanding how our planet's climate is changing is to determine the strength of the __biological pump__. The biological pump is essentially what determines the propotion of sinking biomass in the ocean that becomes trapped at the bottom and can no longer warm the planet as carbond dioxide. A "strong" biological pump traps a lot of carbon in the bottom of the ocean. In a system with a "weak" pump, more of that carbon is respired back into carbon dioxide. The effect of bacteria eating and respiring the carbon that would otherwise be sinking to the ocean floor is called the __microbial loop__. __We need to better understand how the microbial loop works in order to better understand the biological pump and how our oceans and climate will respond to anthropogenic warming.__ A better understanding of the bacteria that live in the ocean and how they interact in communities will contribute to a clearer picture of how our planet works on a system-wide scale and how it may change with a warming climate. --> <p>Much of my Ph.D. thesis examined how and why bacteria of the marine <em>Roseobacter</em> lineage utilize exogenous heme and hemoproteins as nutritional iron sources. The impetus behind this work was to gain a better understanding of the role that heme uptake plays in the overall turnover of iron in the ocean and how marine microbes shape the iron cycle by means of remineralization processes. For my postdoctoral research I am using <em>Prochlorococcus</em> as a model system in the lab and <em>in silico</em> in order to better understand how this abundant and incredibly important organism influences and is influenced by marine trace metal distributions. These projects should provide us with a clearer window into how <em>Prochlorococcus</em> interacts with trace metals and the intersections between trace metal cycles and the marine carbon cycle.</p> <p>–Shane</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/me1.jpg" alt="My Image" /></p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <div align="center"> <small class="block">&copy; 2016 Shane Hogle.
