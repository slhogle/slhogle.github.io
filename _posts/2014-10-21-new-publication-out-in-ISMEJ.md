I participated in a [project](http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ismej2014198a.html) examining the genomes and gene expression of prokaryotic and eukaryptic communities on a transect in the easter subtropical Pacific ocean while collaborating with scientists at the [J. Craig Venter Institute](http://www.jcvi.org/cms/home/). There were a number of scientists from The [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) involved as well.
